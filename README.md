This repository implements a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

**Project Overview**

This project helps retail stores understand their customer base by segmenting them into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior. K-means clustering, an unsupervised learning technique, is used to achieve this.

**Functionality**

**Data Input:** The code allows you to load customer data from a CSV file containing features like total spent, number of transactions, and product categories purchased.
**Feature Selection:** You can choose relevant features that represent customer purchase behavior for clustering.
**K-means Clustering:** The script implements the K-means algorithm to group customers into a user-defined number (K) of clusters.
**Evaluation (Optional):** The code can calculate the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for different K values to aid in selecting the optimal number of clusters.
**Visualization:** The script can generate visualizations like scatter plots to explore how customers are distributed across the identified segments.
